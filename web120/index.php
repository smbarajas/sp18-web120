 <p>My name is Sarah Barajas, and this is my second year here at Seattle Central. I started off pursuing a degree in social services but had a change of heart and now I'm currently pursuing my Associates Degree in Information Systems Software Development. Once I have graduated I am hoping to transfer to Seattle University to get my bachelor's. My dream is to work as a programmer for a large tech firm such as Microsoft, Amazon, or Expedia.</p>

 <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing computer games, wandering around bookstores and reading, watching horror movies, taking things apart to learn about how they work, reading through r/nosleep on reddit and listening to music. I also love black clothing, looking up the camera specs of upcoming smartphones, bath products, and trying new foods! </p>
